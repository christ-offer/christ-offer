### Good *insert time* everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a lowly webdev based in Barcelona. 
I'm currently working at [Seam Project Studios](https://github.com/seam-project-studios), a smol and nice little agency ran by some friends and me. 

We make websites and stuff. Emphasis on websites, occationally stuff.

- ðŸ’¾ Our most common tech stack is anything Vue. Often with Nuxt, but anything goes. More often than not with Supabase if we need it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning (sidehustling), in no particular order: htmx, python, rust
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Ping me here - I already get to much spam everywhere else. :) 

My repository list is full of abandoned side-projects, feel free to explore. Nothing to exciting going on here yet.

âš¡ Fun fact: facts aren't fun.
